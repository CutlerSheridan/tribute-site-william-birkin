      <h3 class="tribute-heading">Here's a small sampling of the incredible work accomplished by our dear Dr. Birkin:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A child prodigy, Birkin completed his doctorate while still a teenager</li>
        <li>At 15, was inducted into Umbrella Pharmaceuticals' Executive Training Program</li>
        <li>Made huge strides in researching the "T-Virus" and "G-Virus", two of our most promising avenues of pharmaceutical discovery</li>
        <li>Has graciously devoted much of his time to helping Lisa Trevorâ€”a poor orphaned girl with an incurable disease</li>
        <li>And somehow he's found time to settle down with his lovely wife, our very own Annette Birkin!  Together, they have one beautiful daughter named Sherry.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Dr. Birkin works every day to make the world a better place.
